# Vehicle Fault Prediction & Anomaly Detection using Autoencoders

**Project Overview:**  
This project aims to predict potential vehicle faults and detect anomalies using data collected from OBD2 diagnostics. Using **MATLAB** and **Autoencoders**, we trained a model to identify unusual patterns in vehicle sensor data that may indicate faults.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Dataset
- Data collected via **OBD2 diagnostic tools** from various vehicles
- Includes sensor readings, error codes, and operational parameters
- Preprocessed and normalized for model training

---

## ðŸ”¹ Approach
- Built and trained an **Autoencoder** in MATLAB to learn normal behavior of vehicle systems
- Applied the trained model to detect deviations (anomalies) indicating potential faults
- Used reconstruction error as a metric to flag abnormal readings

---

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies & Tools
- **Programming / Modeling:** MATLAB  
- **Machine Learning:** Autoencoders (Unsupervised Learning)  
- **Data Processing:** Normalization, Feature Selection  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights
- Developed a predictive model for fault detection
- Anomaly detection for real-time monitoring of vehicle health
- Demonstrates practical application of ML in automotive diagnostics

---

## ðŸ”¹ How to Run
1. Open the MATLAB project/notebook (`.mlx`)  
2. Load the dataset (`data/` folder)  
3. Run the training and evaluation scripts  
4. Check the reconstruction error to identify anomalies
